# TODO: try to improve caching.
#
# We spend a lot of time fetching sources. Caching all of ~/.cache/nix/gitv3 is
# not ideal: it is too large (3GiB) and we don't expire individual checkouts.
# https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache/issues/28 may help.
#
# The "magic" nix cache hits usage limits:
#
#   2024-05-18T06:45:19.165515Z ERROR magic_nix_cache::gha: Upload of path '/nix/store/fpq1vaw8vr88a67lc2jspskf2fa7zbvj-emacs-treepy-20230715.2154' failed: GitHub API error: API error (429 Too Many Requests): StructuredApiError { message: "Request was blocked due to exceeding usage of resource 'Count' in namespace ''." }
#
# This might get better as the cache populates, as long as I don't hit size
# limits.
