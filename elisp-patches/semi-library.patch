Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH] Add library semi.el whose name matches that of the
 package semi

A package should always contain a library with the same name.  One
benefit of that is that Melpa can then extract the package description
from the library commentary.

Remove "semi-pkg.el".  The only additional information it contains is a
version string, which has not ever been bumped since it was first added
in 2014.

[Emacsmirror] This commit is being rebased onto upstream.
